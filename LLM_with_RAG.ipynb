            "Helpful Answer: A Transformer is a machine learning model architecture introduced in the paper \"Attention is All You Need\" by Vaswani et al. in 2017. It's primarily characterized by its use of self-attention mechanisms, which allow the model to weigh the importance of input data at different positions. Unlike recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or long short-term memory (LSTM) networks that process data sequentially, Transformers can process input data in parallel, making them more efficient for tasks like machine translation. The architecture consists of an encoder and a decoder, both made up of stacked layers that include multi-head attention and feed-forward neural networks. Transformers have since been adapted for a wide range of natural language processing tasks, with notable examples including Google's BERT and OpenAI's GPT models.\n"
